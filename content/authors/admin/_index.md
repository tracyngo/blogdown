Hey, I'm Trang. My career ambition is to work in data science because I’m fascinated by the idea of leveraging advanced algorithms to expose and predict patterns in human behavior.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking :curry:, traveling :airplane:, reading manga :books:, and watching anime or food/travel shows :tv:.
